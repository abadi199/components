## Embed an Elm program

The following code shows how to embed an Elm program in some of the most popular JS frameworks. Just copy the relevant code into your project and go from there:

- [Vue](vue.js)

Be sure to read about JavaScript interop in [the official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/). It will explain exactly how these code snippets work and give you the confidence to edit them.
