# Elm at Work

Would you like to try out Elm in an existing project? Do not start with a full rewrite! That is too risky!

Just embed one little Elm node and see how it goes. You can do more if you like it, and you can revert if you do not. No big deal either way!


## Templates

The following code shows how to embed Elm programs in many of the popular JS frameworks. Just copy the code into your project and go from there:

- [React](react.js)
- [Vue](vue.js)

Be sure to read about JavaScript interop in [the official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/). It will explain exactly how these code snippets work and give you the confidence to edit them.
