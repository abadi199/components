# Elm at Work

Would you like to try out Elm in an existing project? Do not rewrite everything, just embed one little Elm node and see how it goes. If you like it, do more! If you do not, just revert back. No big deal.

This repo contains starter templates for embedding Elm programs in a bunch of the popular JS frameworks:

- [React](react.js)
- [Vue](vue.js)

Just copy the relevant code snippet into your project and go from there.

And be sure to read about JavaScript interop in [the official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/). It will explain how everything works and give you the knowledge to make any edits you might need.
